# verticle-horiontal-gradient-script
A working (ish) python script to convert text to a gradient.

This script is poorly made with the well known python gradient script that got leaked, sold etc. Verticle gradients work, but only when all letters in the text file are of the same length as each other. Feel free to edit this, change this however you want I don't care what you do to it.

It was made in near to 5 mins and an example output will be shown below.
