This table will be useful for those who haven't used my tool before giving them some known colours and codes should help them understand how to use it.

To complete a verticle gradient, you must learn the arguments of the script. Here is an example argument below.

```
python3 main.py verti 0,255,0 255,0,255 input.txt
```
This in turn creates a verticle gradient that looks like this

Also complete a horizontal gradient, you must also learn the arguments of the script. Here is an example argument below.

```
python3 main.py hori 0,255,0 255,0,255 input.txt
```
This in turn creates a verticle gradient that looks like this
